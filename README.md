## About the Project

This is a responsive website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes:

- Mobile navigation toggling
- Smooth scrolling behavior for internal links
- Sticky navigation bar on scroll
- Dynamic current year display
- Compatibility fix for missing Flexbox gap support in some Safari versions
- Accessibility enhancements (focus outlines, keyboard navigation support)

The project demonstrates practical skills such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive styling.

## Features

- **Mobile Navigation:** Toggle menu visibility on small screens.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Animated scrolling for internal anchor links.
- **Sticky Header:** Header sticks to the top after scrolling past the hero section.
- **Flexbox Gap Fix:** Detects and applies fallback styles for browsers that don't support flex gap (especially older Safari versions).
- **Dynamic Year:** Automatically updates the footer year to the current calendar year.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Grid and Flexbox)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Intersection Observer API for sticky navigation
- Responsive design techniques for various screen sizes

---



## Notes

- The flexbox gap fallback is necessary because some Safari versions do not support the `gap` property in flex containers.
- The smooth scrolling uses native browser support with a polyfill commented for older browsers.
- This project is a course exercise and demonstrates fundamental frontend skills learned during the course.
